            <h5>Designing a Culture of Design</h5>

            <p>
              Workplace culture doesn’t start with beanbags, foosball tables, or a beer fridge, and it doesn’t end with neckties,
              PCs, or big corporations. It’s the unwritten rules, behavior, beliefs, and the motivations that enable good work to get
              done, or it’s what stifles a workforce. For design to be most effective and for designers to feel valued, we need to
              work in a culture that embraces design and allows it to succeed.
            </p>

            <p>
              In Aaron’s session he will explore how to recognize the traits of organizations that *get* design, both large and small.
              He will share what those teams, departments, and companies have that others don’t, and more importantly, how to begin to
              change your own workplace’s culture. Once you’ve worked within a culture of design it’s almost impossible to imagine
              yourself anywhere else.
            </p>
